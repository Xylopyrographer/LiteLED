paragraph=Provides hardware-accelerated control with support for driving multiple LED strips; arbitrary colour orders; DMA transfers; interrupt priority; and buffer allocation to either internal RAM or PSRAM. Requires an ESP32 SoC with an RMT peripheral. Works concurrently with the WiFi system when run on dual-core versions. Drives RGBW strips with limitations on the W channel.
